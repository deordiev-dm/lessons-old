		<h2>Central part of Ukraine</h2>
		<h3>The capital of Ukraine</h3>
		<h4>Kyiv</h4>
		<h5>Cityscape</h5>
		<p>Modern Kyiv is a mix of the old (Kyiv preserved about 70 percent of more than 1,000 buildings built during
			1907-1914)[134] and the new, seen in everything from the architecture to the stores and to the people
			themselves. When the capital of the Ukrainian SSR was moved from Kharkiv to Kyiv many new buildings were <br>
			commissioned to give the city <br> "the gloss and polish of a capital". In the discussions that centered on how to
			create a showcase city center, the current city center of Khreshchatyk and Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence
			Square) were not the <br> obvious choices. Some of the early, ultimately not materialised, ideas included a part of
			Pechersk, Lypky, European Square, and Mykhailivska Square.</p>
		<h5>Culture</h5>
		<p>Kyiv was the <span>historic cultural centre of the East Slavic civilization</span> and a major cradle for the
			Christianization of Kyivan Rus. Kyiv retained through centuries its cultural importance and even at times of
			relative decay, it remained the centre of primary importance of Eastern Orthodox Christianity. Its sacred
			sites, which include the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra (the Monastery of the Caves) and the Saint Sophia Cathedral are
			probably the most famous, attracted pilgrims for centuries and now recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site
			remain the primary religious centres as well as the major tourist attraction. The above-mentioned sites are
			also part of the Seven Wonders of Ukraine collection.</p>


		<h2>Southern part of Ukraine</h2>
		<h3 id="hometown">My hometown</h3>
		<h4>Mykolaiv</h4>
		<p>Mykolaiv is a city and municipality in Southern Ukraine, the administrative center of the Mykolaiv Oblast.
			Mykolaiv city, which provides Ukraine with access to the Black Sea, is the location of the most downriver
			bridge crossing of the Southern Bug river. This city is one of the main shipbuilding centers of the Black Sea.
			Aside from three shipyards within the city, there are a number of research centers specializing in shipbuilding
			such as the State Research and Design Shipbuilding Center, Zoria-Mashproekt and others. As of 2022, the city
			has a population of 470,011. Mykolaiv holds the honorary title <mark>Hero City of Ukraine</mark>.</p>
		<h4>Cherson</h4>
		<p>Kherson is a port city of Ukraine that serves as the administrative centre of Kherson Oblast. Located on the
			Black Sea and on the Dnieper River, Kherson is the home of a major ship-building industry and is a regional
			economic centre.

			From March to November 2022, the city was occupied by Russian forces during their invasion of Ukraine.
			Ukrainian forces recaptured the city on 11 November 2022.</p>
		<h4>Crimea</h4>
		<p>Крим - це Україна!</p>
		<p>Crimea is a peninsula in Ukraine, on the northern coast of the Black Sea, that has been occupied by Russia
			since 2014. It has a population of 2.4 million. The peninsula is almost entirely surrounded by the Black Sea
			and the smaller Sea of Azov. The Isthmus of Perekop connects the peninsula to Kherson Oblast in mainland
			Ukraine.</p>

		<h2>Western part of Ukraine</h2>
		<h3>Cultural capital of Ukraine</h3>
		<p>
			It serves as the administrative centre of Lviv Oblast and Lviv Raion and is one of the main cultural
			centres of Ukraine. It was named in honour of Leo, the eldest son of Daniel, King of Ruthenia.

			Lviv emerged as the centre of the historical regions of Red Ruthenia and Galicia in the 14th century,
			superseding Halych, Chełm, Belz and Przemyśl.
		<p>
		<h3>Carpathian mountains</h3>
		<p>The Carpathians are the highest mountain range in Ukraine. Hoverla peak (2,061 metres) is the highest point —
			try it if you can! There are lots of tourist routes with different difficulty levels, nature and landscape
			parks, brooks and lakes all this is waiting for you! As well as popular ski and spa resorts.</p>
		<h2>Eastern part of Ukraine</h2>




		<h3>Donetsk</h3>
		<p>Administratively, Donetsk has been the centre of Donetsk Oblast, while historically, it is the unofficial
			capital
			and
			largest city of the larger economic and cultural Donets Basin (Donbas) region.</p>
		<p>Since April 2014, Donetsk and its surrounding areas have been one of the major sites of fighting in the ongoing
			Russo-Ukrainian War, as pro-Russian separatist forces battle against Ukrainian military forces for control of
			the
			city
			and surrounding areas.
		</p>
		<h3>Mariupol</h3>
		<p>Historically, the city of Mariupol was a centre for trade and manufacturing, and played a key role in the
			development
			of higher education and many businesses while also serving as a coastal resort on the Sea of Azov. </p>
		<p>Beginning on 24 February 2022, the three-month-long siege of Mariupol by Russian forces largely destroyed the
			city,
			for which it was given the title "Hero City of Ukraine" by the Ukrainian government.[6] On 16 May 2022, all
			Ukrainian
			troops who remained in Mariupol surrendered at Azovstal Iron and Steel Works, as the Russian military secured
			complete control over the city by 20 May 2022</p>
