			<p class="example-1">
				One of HTML's main jobs is to give text structure so that a browser can display an HTML document the way its
				developer intends. This article explains the way HTML can be used to structure a page of text by adding
				headings and paragraphs, emphasizing words, creating lists, and more.

		<div class="page__section section">
			<h2 class="section__title title">The basics: headings and paragraphs</h2>
			<p class="example-2">
				Most structured text consists of headings and paragraphs, whether you are reading a story, a newspaper, a
				college textbook, a magazine, etc.Most structured text consists of headings and paragraphs, whether you are

			<p class="example-3">Structured content makes the reading experience easier and more enjoyable.</p>

			<p class="example-4">In HTML, each paragraph has to be wrapped in a <span>&lt;p&gt;</span> element</p>

			<p class="example-5">Each heading has to be wrapped in a heading element</p>

			<p class="example-6">
				There are six heading elements: <span>&lt;h1&gt;</span>, <span>&lt;h2&gt;</span>, <span>&lt;h3&gt;</span>,
				<span>&lt;h4&gt;</span>, <span>&lt;h5&gt;</span>, and <span>&lt;h6&gt;</span>.
				Each element represents a different level of content in
				the document; <span>&lt;h1&gt;</span> represents the main heading, <span>&lt;h2&gt;</span> represents
				subheadings, <span>&lt;h3&gt;</span>
				represents sub-subheadings, and so on.
			</p>

			<br>

			<div class="section__subsection subsection">
				<h3 class="subsection__title title">Implementing structural hierarchy</h3>
				<p class="example-7">
					It's really up to you what the elements involved represent, as long as the hierarchy makes sense. You
					just need to bear in mind a few best practices as you create such structures:
				</p>
				<ul class="subsection__list list">
					<li class="example-8">
						Preferably, you should use a single <span>&lt;h1&gt;</span> per page—this is the top level heading,
						and all others
						sit below this in the hierarchy.
					</li>
					<li class="example-9">Make sure you use the headings in the correct order in the hierarchy. Don't use
						<span>&lt;h3&gt;</span> elements
						to represent subheadings, followed by <span>&lt;h2&gt;</span> elements to represent
						sub-subheadings—that doesn't
						make sense and will lead to weird results.
					</li>
					<li>
						Of the six heading levels available, you should aim to use no more than three per page, unless you
						feel it is necessary. Documents with many levels (for example, a deep heading hierarchy) become
						unwieldy and difficult to navigate. On such occasions, it is advisable to spread the content over
						multiple pages if possible.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<br>

			<div class="section__subsection subsection">
				<h3 class="subsection__title title">Why do we need structure?</h3>
				<ul class="subsection__list list">
					<li class="example-10">
						Users looking at a web page tend to scan quickly to find relevant content, often just reading the
						headings, to begin with. (We usually spend a very short time on a web page.) If they can't see
						anything useful within a few seconds, they'll likely get frustrated and go somewhere else.
					</li>
					<li class="example-11">
						Search engines indexing your page consider the contents of headings as important keywords for
						influencing the page's search rankings. Without headings, your page will perform poorly in terms of
						SEO (Search Engine Optimization).
					</li>
					<li class="example-12">
						Severely visually impaired people often don't read web pages; they listen to them instead. This is
						done with
						software called a screen reader. This software provides ways to get fast access to given text content.
						Among the various techniques used, they provide an outline of the document by reading out the
						headings,
						allowing their users to find the information they need quickly. If headings are not available, they
						will be
						forced to listen to the whole document read out loud.
					</li>
					<li class="example-13">
						To style content with CSS, or make it do interesting things with JavaScript, you need to have elements
						wrapping the relevant content, so CSS/JavaScript can effectively target it.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Therefore, we need to give our content structural markup.
				</p>
			</div>

			<br>

			<div class="section__subsection subsection">
				<h3 class="subsection__title title">Why do we need semantics?</h3>
				<p>
					Semantics are relied on everywhere around us—we rely on previous experience to tell us what the function
					of an everyday object is; when we see something, we know what its function will be. So, for example, we
					expect
					a red traffic light to mean "stop," and a green traffic light to mean "go." Things can get tricky very
					quickly if the wrong semantics are applied. (Do any countries use red to mean "go"? We hope not.)
				</p>

				<p>
					In a similar way, we need to make sure we are using the correct elements, giving our content the correct
					meaning, function, or appearance. In this context, the <span>&lt;h1&gt;</span> element is also a semantic
					element,
					which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page."
				</p>

				<p>
					By default, the browser will give it a large font size to make it look like a heading (although you could
					style it to look like anything you wanted using CSS). More importantly, its semantic value will be used
					in multiple ways, for example by search engines and screen readers (as mentioned above).
				</p>

				<p>
					This is a <span>&lt;span&gt;</span> element. It has no semantics. You use it to wrap content when you
					want to apply
					CSS to it (or do something to it with JavaScript) without giving it any extra meaning. (You'll find out
					more about these later on in the course.) We've applied some CSS to it to make it look like a top level
					heading, but since it has no semantic value, it will not get any of the extra benefits described above.
					It is a good idea to use the relevant HTML element for the job.
